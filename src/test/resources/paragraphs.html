    <div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Amplitude',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.</span>

    <div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Amplitude',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. </span>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Amplitude',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated.</span>

    <div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Amplitude',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.</span>

    <div style="margin-bottom:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Amplitude',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis.</span>

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflects the recognition of an income tax benefit of $566&nbsp;million related to finalizing the Firm’s 2020 U.S. federal tax return, which reduced the Firm’s effective tax rate by 4.0% and 1.2% respectively. The tax benefit included state and local impacts of federal tax method changes and a reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. foreign tax credits.
